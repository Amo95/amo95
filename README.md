<h1>Hey, I'm James Amo 👋🇬🇭</h1>
<h3>An enthusiastic SWE currently based in Ghana 🇬🇭</h3>
<p>
I am a software engineer with over **{{years_of_experience}}** years of professional experience and an entrepreneur. I am an ardent believer of innovative ideas to changing the world and making it a better place.
<br><br>
The rapid growth of technology fascinates me - although I am quite fresh professionally, I've experienced some great tools which makes my work faster and better. I love the idea of going through a creative process and implementing a dynamic but effective solution to a problem. It's fun! Owing to this reason, I have been investing my time and effort into working on projects, resolving prod level issues, automating/testing code and many among other experiences with the plan of drilling my way deeper into programming. Well - aside being a dev, I'm a security enthusiast. I love to skate too.
